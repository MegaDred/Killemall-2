# Killemall-2

This is a console game about a space traveler who makes his way through armadas of robots and thousands of light years.

This game is for Windows, but you can play it on Linux too (with some problems).

## Controls

To control your spaceship, press `←` `↑` `↓` `→` keys and hit `space` to shoot motherfuckers ahead. Stop shooting to restore your energy. If you were shot by one of this fucking bastards, press `enter` and keep fucking them up. Press `esc` to pause the game. Also you can open infopanel by pressing `c`.

## Types of enemies

1. Simple little fucking robot, that has a completly fucked cannon, that causes meager damage (you have the same one).
2. Fat motherfucking spaceship, that have either machinegun or fucking ultragun, shoots a concentrated stream of projectiles.
3. New enemies coming soon...

## Sandbox mode

In default game mode enemies spawn with some probability, but in sandbox mode spawning is disabled. Check `config.json` to enable sandbox mode. You can spawn enemies manually. Press `1` to spawn a Bot and `2` to spawn Divider.
